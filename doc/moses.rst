:abstract:
   Even though I invented a check valve for a wave-powered seawater desalination system and published the CAD data,
   it did not attract much attention,
   so I decided to write a science fiction novel to promote it with the help of the LLM.
   Many civilians were massacred by the Hamas and the Likud coalition.
   Time will not wait.
   I want as many people as possible to know my thoughts as soon as possible.
   This novel is a fictional story and is not related to any real people or organizations.

Chapter 1: Invitation of the Sea
================================

Section 1: Encounter at the Exhibition
--------------------------------------

The vast halls of Tokyo Big Sight were filled with numerous booths, and participants exchanged information with excitement.

Emilia Sanders, a woman with short blonde hair, blue eyes, and an air of intelligence with her glasses, strolled through the venue. She wore a white shirt and beige pants, giving off a professional impression. As a hydraulic engineer, she was keen on new technologies, especially those related to marine energy.

Entering the venue, Emilia was amazed by the many intriguing booths. Among them, she noticed a slender middle-aged Japanese man. Wearing glasses, he was enthusiastically explaining something, and a group of interested participants had gathered around him.

Approaching the man's booth, Emilia listened intently to his explanation. In broken English, he talked about his unique seawater desalination technology.

"With this check valve, you can lift seawater up to a high position using only wave power. Then, you can use that potential energy to pass through the reverse osmosis membrane!"

Emilia was fascinated, though the man's English was somewhat difficult to understand. Despite this, she listened eagerly, albeit with a wry smile.

"It's a small-scale, environmentally friendly system. I came up with it inspired by the human lower limb veins!"

Excitedly, Emilia pondered the potential of this technology. Intrigued by this new approach to seawater desalination, she intended to explore the exhibition further. Just then, her smartphone began to ring.

"It's a call from Arif Khan," the screen displayed. Surprised, Emilia decided to answer it then and there. With expectations rising for new developments at the exhibition, she picked up her smartphone.

The Japanese man continues speaking, "Do you all understand the English I speak? That's wonderful! I don't understand the English I speak."


Section 2: Moment of Decision
-----------------------------

The plan to transfer water from the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea had been proposed multiple times in the past but had never come to fruition. However, with the resignation of the Likud coalition government and the formation of a peace-promoting cabinet in Israel, the situation was changing.

In Israel, a large-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip led to international condemnation due to civilian casualties. This event exerted strong pressure on the United States government, prompting a move towards significant intervention in Palestine-Israel peace efforts.

Amidst this, the past water transfer plan garnered attention once again. At the United Nations, a proposal was put forward by Rebecca Hamilton of the U.S. government and Sara al-Jabri of Jordan for a United States of Palestine and Israel.

Within the U.S. government, there were cautious discussions about the revival of the water transfer plan. However, with the addition of the crucial element of the return of Palestinian refugees, expectations for the plan grew.

Emilia Sanders was acquainted with Arif Khan, who was involved in this plan. He had recommended her to the American government officials. She was intrigued by the revival of the water transfer plan and would play a significant role in it.

At the United Nations debate, Emilia listened to the proposals of Rebecca Hamilton from the U.S. and Sara al-Jabri from Jordan.

Rebecca Hamilton explained the significance of the water transfer plan.

"Once, there was a water transfer plan that utilized the elevation difference from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea [cite1]_, but it failed. Amidst environmental issues and escalating conflicts, we must revive this plan. Why? Because this plan includes the crucial element of the return of Palestinian refugees. For Palestinian landowners whom the Israeli government cannot return their land [cite2]_, we will provide alternative settlements."

Next to take the stage was a woman dressed in sophisticated attire, exuding a confident aura. With intelligent eyes and a firm set to her lips, she emanated strong conviction and an unyielding will. It was Sara al-Jabri delivering her speech.

"While we sympathize with the Israelis who have been wandering for thousands of years, this does not justify expelling Palestinians and confining them to narrow spaces. It is a modern-day confiscation violating ownership rights. We demand the return of Palestinians. They have the right to return to their homeland. This plan is essential for regional stability and peace. We aim for a state where Palestinians and Israelis can live together. Jordan's government will also participate in this plan. Specifically, we will expand the Aqaba-Amman Water Desalination and Conveyance Project (AAWDCP) and create alternative settlements to facilitate the return of Palestinians to their rightful homes."

Emilia realized that this plan was not just a water resource development project. It was a historical project with the potential to resolve the Palestinian issue.

"Can I participate in this plan? I believe my expertise would be valuable."

She reached out to a man with a calm demeanor, wearing traditional Pakistani attire, Salwar Kameez, with black hair and beard.

Arif Khan: "Emilia, please do participate. Your experience and skills are invaluable to this plan."

Emilia and Arif Khan shook hands, exchanging smiles. Emilia had made her decision to stake her efforts on this plan.
