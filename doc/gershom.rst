Chapter 3: Bridging Waters
==========================

Section 1: Green Future
-----------------------

Under the regional greening project connecting the Red Sea to the Dead Sea, representatives including Leila Al-Fardi from Palestine, Sarah Al-Jabri from Jordan, and Amir Goldstein from Israel gathered at the International Conference Center in Amman to discuss water allocation.

Daniel Cohen provided detailed explanations on the technical aspects of the water conveyance project while discussing the technical challenges and possibilities in water allocation.

Daniel Cohen: "In this project, we will utilize the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea to construct a conveyance system for supplying water to the Dead Sea while generating electricity simultaneously. This will effectively utilize the region's water resources and build a sustainable environment."

Drawing on his knowledge of geology and topography, Arif Khan proposed suitable routes for the conveyance system considering the region's terrain and discussed its feasibility.

Arif Khan: "By considering the region's geology and topography, we can determine the optimal route for the conveyance system, minimizing its impact on the environment and ecosystems. It's crucial to exclude heritage sites and natural reserves from the route. In Jordan's Aqaba Governorate, there are wadis (seasonal rivers), and upstream there are dams [cite12]_ [cite13]_. We should utilize these existing water supply systems and integrate them."

Representing Israel, Amir Goldstein discussed Israel's position on water allocation and proposed ideas regarding the return of Palestinian refugees and alternative settlement sites.

Amir Goldstein: "If this project is realized, it is expected to have a positive impact on the entire region. The return of Palestinian refugees and the establishment of alternative settlement sites would contribute to regional peace and stability."

Concerns were raised about the extensive funding required to realize the project. During the meeting, discussions were held on the negotiation process with potential financiers, including the World Bank, various governments, and private investors through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).

Emilia: "To realize this project, we need funding on the scale of billions of dollars. We must actively negotiate with the World Bank, various governments, and private enterprises."

Leila: "The World Bank has a track record of financing sustainable development projects. By emphasizing environmental protection and consideration for local communities, we may be able to secure financing."

Sarah: "Engaging with various governments is crucial, especially neighboring Arab countries. Forming agreements on water allocation and building cooperation based on common interests are essential."

Amir: "Methods like PFI need to be considered as well. By leveraging the funds and expertise of private enterprises, we can efficiently advance the project."

Representatives from each country shared specific ideas on fundraising and deepened the discussion.

Emilia: "Funding won't be easy, but through persistent negotiations with stakeholders, we will make it happen."

The atmosphere in the conference room was filled with hope and determination.


Section 2: Miracle of the Dead Sea
----------------------------------

As the flow of water began to recover, the results of the water conveyance project started to show. Emilia Sanders and her team obtained special permission to head to a location slightly away from the Dead Sea to investigate the situation around it.

The waves gently lapped at the shore, and at night, the humidity increased, causing the surrounding plants to glisten with dew. The water level of the Dead Sea rose, and new green oases were emerging along the shore. The once barren landscape was coming back to life.

Emilia carefully observed the effects of the water level rise brought about by the water conveyance project and continued the investigation with her team.

Emilia: "This is a remarkable change. The success of the water conveyance project has increased the humidity around the Dead Sea, activating local vegetation and greenery."

They walked along the coastline, witnessing the transformation of once salty, barren land now covered in green vegetation, birds soaring in the sky, and new life thriving.

Meanwhile, the local residents, embracing the change, began to walk towards a new future with joy. Local tourism operators also rejoiced at the resurgence of the beautiful scenery around the Dead Sea. Furthermore, the rise in the Dead Sea's water level led to the revival of wells and springs.

The miracle brought about by the water conveyance project brought new hope to the lives of the people in the region, and Emilia and her team watched with joy as they witnessed its results.

Section 3: Land of Coexistence

As the water conveyance project progressed, the development of settlements began. In an effort to make effective use of the vacant land along the border between Israel and Jordan, a joint settlement involving Palestinians was planned. A landmine removal plan was centralized around Damian.

In this joint settlement, a dispute arose between Israeli and Palestinian architects regarding the prayer space. Michael Levi and Saleem Abdulrahman disagreed on whether to have a separate prayer space. Michael favored the separation of prayer spaces, while Saleem advocated for a shared chapel for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

"Even in a moderate joint settlement like this, we cannot maintain a shared chapel," argued Michael.

However, Saleem retorted discontentedly, "That's not true. Only a few people engage in extremist actions."

The debate grew heated, and other residents of the settlement became divided in their opinions. Tensions escalated, and the rift deepened.

At that moment, a woman stood up quietly. She was a Jordanian immigrant who owned a house in the settlement and was deeply religious. Her name was Sara Al-Jabri.

Sara: "Everyone, we chose to live together here. Israelis and Palestinians alike must strive to live peacefully together. Religious conflicts diminish our strength. We must respect each other and find ways to coexist."

Sara's words struck a chord with the residents of the settlement. Michael and Saleem locked eyes and took a deep breath. They realized they needed to transcend their religious differences and decided to build a shared prayer space together.

Michael: "Sara, you're right. We shouldn't be in conflict; we need to cooperate."

Saleem: "I agree. By building a prayer space together, we can begin the path of coexistence."

Israeli and Palestinian people joined hands to establish the prayer space, symbolizing the beginning of a new era of coexistence.
