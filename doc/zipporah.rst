Chapter 2: The Unknown Waterway
===============================

Section 1: Calm Seas
--------------------

At Ben Gurion International Airport, amidst the hustle and bustle, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon Levi personally welcomed Emilia. She was a fervent supporter of this project.

With her silver hair and sharp eyes, Sharon exuded an intimidating aura, yet Emilia felt a warmth in the occasional smile she displayed, a kindness that watched over people.

First, Emilia was introduced to Damian White, an American who was assigned to guard her. A former military man, now working as a military consultant, he was tasked by the U.S. government to ensure that history did not repeat itself with another assassination like that of Prime Minister Rabin. At Prime Minister Levi's request, he was also assigned to oversee the security of the water transfer project. He would accompany Emilia from now on.

Emilia: "My ancestors immigrated from Ireland during the potato famine. Did yours too?"

Damian: "Yes, you're well-versed in history. Actually, my family were potato farmers. Coming to America and still growing potatoes must mean they went through a lot. Is your family frying chicken?"

Emilia: "No!"

After bidding farewell to Prime Minister Levi at the press conference, the group headed south. Their destination was a port town.

Daniel Cohen, an Israeli water purification facility technician, entered the meeting room. He wore glasses and a plain appearance, always in worn-out work clothes, with messy hair. However, he had a solid demeanor and an intellectual gaze. Emilia welcomed him and extended her hand.

Emilia: "Welcome, Daniel. Thank you for joining our project."

Daniel: "Thank you, Emilia. I'm honored to be involved in this project. As a water purification facility technician, I will do my best."

The handshake between Emilia and Daniel symbolized the beginning of a new step.

The view from the meeting room window was the emerald green Gulf of Aqaba and the distant mountains. In the sunshine, the quiet coastline stretched out. In this beautiful landscape, their mission began.

"John Smith here. My specialty is marine engineering. And no, it's not a fake name."

Emilia chuckled beside Damian's suspicious look. "Haha, that's a common assumption with names. Well, let's start with assessing the environmental impact of the Gulf of Aqaba. We need your expertise, John Smith."

"Understood. I'll start working right away."

They began their work in the meeting room, conducting a detailed assessment of the environmental impact of the Gulf of Aqaba.

Emilia: "John, what do you think the impact on marine life in the Gulf of Aqaba might be?"

John: "It's still in the investigation stage, but we're concerned about the impact on coral reefs and plankton. Especially, the change in salinity due to seawater pumping needs attention."

Emilia: "I see. What measures do you think are necessary to minimize the impact on the environment?"

John: "Adjustment of seawater pumping volume and adoption of technologies with minimal impact on marine life are some considerations."

Emilia: "Thank you. Let's proceed with careful consideration, taking into account the opinions of environmental organizations."

Emilia and John delved into discussions about the environmental impact assessment.

The atmosphere in the meeting room was increasingly charged. Geologist Arif Khan provided data on terrain and geological conditions, while environmental conservationists Isa Abdul and Nadia Alhani from `the Royal Marine Conservation Society of Jordan (JREDS) <http://www.jreds.org/en-us/>`__ expressed concerns about the local ecosystem.

Isa Abdul: "Seawater desalination holds great potential for regional development, but we must carefully consider its impact on the precious ecosystem of the Gulf of Aqaba. Our mission is to strike a balance between development and environmental protection."

Nadia Alhani: "Fish and sea turtles, as well as the abundant marine life of the Gulf of Aqaba, are our valuable assets. When introducing seawater desalination, prioritizing the protection of coral reefs and other marine life is essential. Implementing measures to minimize environmental impact is crucial."

Emilia listened carefully to each opinion and worked to adjust the plan accordingly.

Emilia: "Thank you for your valuable input. We will do our best to minimize the impact on the environment and realize a sustainable plan."

Outside the meeting room window, the blue sea of the Gulf of Aqaba stretched far away. Its silent waves seemed to push forward their determination.

Emilia renewed her resolve. She would give her all to ensure that this project contributed to the peace and prosperity of the region.


Section 2: Encounter of Engineers
---------------------------------

The team first inspected the seawater desalination plant, known as the Sabha Plant [cite3]_ [cite4]_ [cite5]_ [cite6]_ [cite7]_. Daniel Cohen guided them through the facility and explained about the water supply in Eilat.

"This is called the 'Sabha C Plant.' It was the first seawater desalination facility built in Israel and the Middle East. Initially, it used evaporation methods, but later upgraded to reverse osmosis."

Emilia asked, "What makes this facility different from others?"

"This facility can desalinate water from both seawater and groundwater, all in the same place. It's one of the most advanced seawater desalination facilities in the world. Additionally, the reverse osmosis process in the facility is highly energy-efficient and environmentally friendly."

Sara looked around the facility with admiration. She understood the technological advancement of the Sabha C Plant and its significant contribution to the region's livelihoods and tourism.

Next, they exchanged ideas about involving private companies in the project.

Daniel: "This is a state-owned company, but it would be beneficial to have private sector involvement as well. Utilizing existing facilities and expanding their functions is the best approach. The Israeli Highway 90 and Jordan's Highway 65 along the Wadi Araba are considered optimal roads for laying the pipeline from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea. The Sabha C Plant is ideally located for this. We should be able to green a wide area."

Arif Khan also points out, "Laying the pipeline along the Jordan Rift Valley would be ideal."

They then conducted an agricultural inspection around Eilat. Emilia and the team visited agricultural facilities and engaged in discussions with local farmers.

While walking through the farmland around Eilat, Emilia enjoyed conversations with Israeli farmers who were working diligently in the desert, contributing to the regional economy.

Emilia approached one farmer, Ari Dayan, and asked, "Ari, what are the challenges facing agriculture in this area?"

Ari replied, "First and foremost, it's water. To farm in the desert, water efficiency is essential. Also, the rising salinity of groundwater due to excessive pumping is a problem."

Yasmin Khalidi, a representative of the Bedouin community standing next to Ari, added, "Indeed, we Bedouins also face water issues. Water is the source of life for us who have lived in this land for generations."

Listening to their stories, Emilia understood the difficulty of agriculture in the Negev desert.

Later, during a conversation with Bedouin representatives, they discussed their history and persecution.

Yasmin Khalidi said, "The Bedouin history is long, and we have been living in this land for generations. However, modernization has brought significant changes to our lives. Persecution, territorial disputes between nations, and resulting instability have been ongoing issues. Besides working on this farm, I also work as a tour guide. You can experience Bedouin life in the Negev Desert. How about you?"

Emilia listened attentively, understanding the challenges they faced.

Afterward, Emilia and the team toured the drip irrigation systems in the farmlands and continued discussions with the farmers.

Emilia remarked, "This drip irrigation system is wonderful. It contributes to efficient water use."

Ari responded, "Indeed. We used to rely on groundwater, but due to rising salinity, we switched to this system. Now we can use water more efficiently."

Emilia praised their efforts, understanding the impact of their initiatives on the environment.

Next, Emilia and the team passed through the border checkpoint and departed for a local inspection in Aqaba, Jordan, guided by Ahmad Harris. While riding in the limousine, Emilia felt it was a bit extravagant, but she decided to follow their lead.

Looking out the window, they saw the scenery around the Aqaba Gulf. Olive and date trees along the coast and scattered farmland in the desert caught their eyes.

Ahmad Harris said, "Fruit tree cultivation [cite8]_, such as olives and dates, is thriving in this region. Local farmers struggle to cultivate in this dry land, but the wind blowing from the Gulf of Aqaba helps retain moisture. Recently, the Sahara Forest Project has been planting trees here."

Emilia was impressed by the sight of farmers toiling hard and understood their contribution to the regional economy.

Along the coastline, they observed fishing boats swaying on the waves and fishers pulling up nets.

Ahmad Harris commented, "Fishing is also a significant industry in the region. However, in recent years, fish species and catch volumes have decreased due to rising sea temperatures and pollution."

Emilia thought about the importance of protecting the sea, recalling the significance of coral conservation.

"Coastal coral reefs play a vital role in the local ecosystem. However, they may be threatened by pollution and excessive tourism. What initiatives are in place for coral protection locally?" Emilia asked.

With a deep sigh, Ahmad began discussing coral protection efforts.

"Local environmental organizations like JREDS are focusing on coral protection, but challenges remain due to expanding tourism and local habitat encroachment. We aim for sustainable development and coral protection, but the challenges are immense."

Emilia admired the local efforts for coral protection and resolved to continue the discussion further.


Section 3: Resonance of the Region
----------------------------------

Following the order of inspections, Emilia and the planning team first visited the base of tourism operators. Guided by Ahmad, they inspected beaches, local hotels, and tourist facilities and held meetings with tourism operators.

Emilia: "Local tourism is a vital element for the regional economy. Especially, there must be many tourists coming for scuba diving to see the coral reefs, right? We plan to conduct an environmental impact assessment before fully implementing the intake plan for the seawater desalination system to prevent salinity rise. Any questions?"

Among the attendees, one hotel owner spoke up.

Layla Najim: "Large resorts require a significant amount of water. We are always concerned about water availability. We also treat and reuse wastewater. Of course, as local tourism operators, we strive to protect and promote sustainable tourism for the region's tourism resources. We don't want to compromise the landscape, but we also recognize the importance of the water intake project. So, my proposal is, how about using it as an environmental education space? We want to create eco-friendly facilities that divers from around the world can be proud of."

Nadia Al-Hani, from JREDS, who also works here, spoke up.

"That's an interesting proposal. Development and conservation often conflict, but with the right approach, they can be reconciled. Also, if the intakes are small, they can be installed in marinas within resort facilities."

Next, they moved to the base of maritime shipping companies and investigated the current situation of the shipping industry and its environmental impact. Emilia and the team inspected port facilities and shipping equipment and held meetings with shipping companies.

Isa Abdul, a member of JREDS working at the port facility, spoke up.

"Installing large seawater desalination units at ports capable of docking large cruise ships can minimize environmental impact. We'll brainstorm ways to install them without obstructing ships. Industrial areas should also be considered as installation sites."

Emilia: "Thank you. For the intake project, we need not only small but also large systems. It's a strong candidate for the installation site."

After that, Emilia and the team visited fishing ports and boats, and exchanged views with fishers.

During the meeting, hamour [cite9]_ dishes were served, and discussions took place over the meal.

Damian whispered to Emilia, "Phew, I'm glad it's not sushi. I'm not a fan of raw fish."

Emilia: "We need to attach anchors to the intake for the seawater desalination system. But it won't be just any anchors; we plan to make them artificial fishing reefs."

Nadia made a sarcastic remark.

Nadia Al-Hani: "Since fishing is an indispensable industry for local livelihoods, achieving sustainable fishing requires regulations on catch volumes and stronger management. Decreased catch volume may not be solely due to environmental degradation, right?"

One of the fishers spoke up.

Fares Al-Hariri: "Of course, conservation of the marine ecosystem and the development of fisheries must go hand in hand. Sustainable management of fisheries resources is essential. It would be great to have places where fish can spawn and young fish can grow. If the fish disappear, we'll have to close down."

Finally, they moved to a base for agriculture near Aqaba and held a meeting on the current situation and challenges of local agriculture. Emilia and the team inspected vegetable greenhouse cultivation [cite10]_ and irrigation facilities and exchanged views with farmers.

One of the farmers spoke up.

Mohammad Al-Harimi: "Efficient water use and soil management are crucial to ensure the sustainability of agriculture. Local farmers are working on this, but with many small-scale farmers, further support is needed."

Isa Abdul: "Agriculture plays an important role in the regional economy, but faces challenges such as water shortage and rising salinity of groundwater and soil. Technological innovation and policy support are needed for sustainable agriculture."

Lastly, a visit to Taba in Egypt was conducted. Emilia and the team visited the beautiful beaches and resort facilities in Taba and held meetings with local tourism operators.

Emilia asked an interesting question to the tourism operators.

Emilia: "How has tourism in Taba developed? And what are the impacts on the local community and the environment?"

One of the local tourism operators responded.

Karim Najim: "Taba is known for its beautiful coastline and coral reefs, attracting an increasing number of tourists each year. However, this rapid tourism development also affects local livelihoods. Excessive tourism development in some areas has negative effects on the living environment and coral reefs. We strongly feel the need for sustainable tourism development."

Emilia understood their concerns and reaffirmed the importance of sustainable tourism. Discussions were then held on efforts for coral reef protection and local community development.

Emilia dived into the waters of the Aqaba Gulf to observe the coral reefs. The colorful coral reefs and diverse marine life delighted her. John, who was accustomed to scuba diving, led the way. Damian, wary of John, followed along. They experienced the unique features of the Aqaba Gulf's rapidly deepening terrain.

Emilia and the team enjoyed interacting with the local people while appreciating the beautiful natural environment and tourism resources of Taba.


Section 4: Waves of the Future
------------------------------

Emilia took out a sample of a wave-powered seawater desalination device from her bag and proposed it to the planning team.

Emilia: "Everyone, take a look at this. This is a small-scale wave-powered seawater desalination device using a check valve-equipped intake port that I found at a trade show in Tokyo. Because it's small, we can disperse the intake ports and spread them out like veins. Let's conduct a demonstration experiment to desalinate seawater from the Aqaba Gulf using this device. We'll show the locals the effectiveness of this system and demonstrate the potential of the project."

The planning team expressed their approval of Emilia's proposal.

Arif: "That's a fantastic idea, Emilia. Actually running it will prove the potential of this system."

Layla: "The cooperation of the local people is essential. We need to explain to them the benefits of this project and get their support."

Emilia, along with the planning team, began preparations for the demonstration experiment. They cooperated with local fishers and tourism operators to choose a location for installing the device and obtained the necessary permits.

Several weeks later, the device was completed, and the demonstration experiment began. The device used the power of the waves and a check valve to lift seawater and separate seawater and freshwater using a reverse osmosis membrane. It was confirmed that the separated freshwater could be used for drinking and irrigation purposes.

Emilia: "The experiment was a success! This device can efficiently desalinate seawater using the wave power of the Aqaba Gulf. By dispersing the intake ports, we can also prevent the increase in salinity."

The locals were amazed by the results of the demonstration experiment and cheered with joy.

Fares Al-Hariri: "With this, we won't have to worry about water for washing ship hulls."

Mohammad Al-Harimi: "With this, we can grow salt-resistant crops."

Emilia, seeing the success of the demonstration experiment, became confident in the potential of the project.


Section 5: Venturing into the Depths of the Sea
-----------------------------------------------

Emilia and the planning team were progressing with their investigations for the construction of a larger-scale system. As part of these investigations, they decided to explore the possibility of extracting deep-sea water [cite11]_ from the Aqaba Gulf.

Deep-sea water was believed to be suitable for seawater desalination because of its low temperature, low bacteria content, and reduced need for disinfectants. With the cooperation of the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian governments, Emilia chartered a research vessel and set out to the waters offshore from the Aqaba Gulf.

From the sea, Emilia saw the cities of Aqaba and Eilat, and they appeared as utopian visions for the future of the waterway project. If the project proceeded smoothly, settlement development would begin, serving as a reference for the future.

The research vessel spent several days conducting investigations into deep-sea water. Data on water temperature, salinity, nutrients, and other factors were collected, confirming that deep-sea water was suitable for seawater desalination.

John: "The results of the investigation are promising. By utilizing deep-sea water, we can desalinate seawater more efficiently. It's also cold, so it can be used for regional air conditioning."

Emilia was satisfied with the results of the deep-sea water investigation. She felt that they had taken a significant step towards realizing the project.

Emilia: "The future of the Aqaba Gulf is right in front of us."
